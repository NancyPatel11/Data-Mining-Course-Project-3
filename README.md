# Task 1

**Problem 1:**

**Predicting runs on each ball**

In order to predict runs on each ball, we used the datasets given below:

1. deliveries.csv


To predict the runs on each ball, we used the following .ipynb files which were imported as pickle files and used in our ball_prediction_api's 'predict' function:

1. ball_prediction.ipynb

This file predicts the 'runs_off_bat' (runs on each ball) based on 'venue', 'batting team', 'bowling team' and 'striker', 'non striker', 'bowler', 'extras' and 'wides', 'no balls', 'byes', 'leg byes' and 'penalty', 'wicket type',and 'player dismissed'. 
We import this file as ball_prediction_rfc.pkl and used it in ball_prediction_api.py .

We have used deep neural network (dnn) as one of the models for prediction in this task. In the ball_prediction_api, for the label encoding fitting data, we have passed the pre-processed data from ball_prediction.ipynb as ball_prediction.csv .

**Problem 2:**

# Task 2

**Finalist Team Prediction**

In order to generate the two finalist teams, we used the datasets given below:

1. upcoming_matches.csv:

2. deliveries.csv

3. points_table.csv

4. matches.csv

5. match_summary.csv

To generate the finalist teams, we used the following .ipynb files which were imported as pickle files and used in our api's 'predict' function:

1. toss_decision.ipynb

This file predicts the 'toss_decision' (field/bat) based on 'team1', 'team2', 'venue' and 'toss_winner'. 
We import this file as toss_decision.pkl and used it in api.py to predict the toss_decision for all the upcoming_matches.

2. total_run_prediction_inning_1.ipynb

This file predicts the 'total_runs_per_inning_match' (i.e the total runs made in a inning of a match) based on inputs such as 'batting_team', 'bowling_team', 'venue' and 'Total_Overs_Played'. These runs are generated only for the team batting in the first inning.
We import this file as runs_inning_1.pkl and used it in api.py to predict the runs made by team 1 in first inning for all the upcoming matches.

3. total_run_prediction_inning_2.ipynb

This file predicts the 'total_runs_per_inning_match' (i.e the total runs made in a inning of a match) based on inputs such as 'batting_team', 'bowling_team', 'venue' and 'Total_Overs_Played'. These runs are generated only for the team batting in the second inning.
We import this file as runs_inning_2.pkl and used it in api.py to predict the runs made by team 2 in second inning for all the upcoming matches.

4. total_over_pediction.ipynb
This file predicts 'Total_Overs_Played' (i.e. the number of overs faced by the batting team) based on  'batting_team', 'bowling_team', 'venue', 'innings' and 'total_runs_per_inning_match'. 
We import this file as overs.pkl and used it in api.py to predict the overs played by team 1 in inning 1 and team2 in inning 2.

Now, we checked that if the overs predicted were greater than 50, then we updated the predicted runs as predicted_runs * 50 / predicted_overs. 

Next, compare the predicted runs for both team1 and team2. The team with greated runs wins the match. 

We update the points for the winning team by adding 2. Also, we find the net run rate for each of the teams by using the formula (total runs made by the team in this match) / (total overs played by the team in this match). 

Now, we sort the points table based on points, Net Run Rate in descending order.

Next we call the 'predict_finalist' function in our api. This function takes the input as the final points table generated as above. Now, two semifinal matches will be played between:

a. team 1 and team 4 

b. team 2 and team 3

Based on their position in the points table, those teams are taken as input and the same process of predicting the runs and overs for innings 1 and 2 is done. Based on the winners of the semifinals, we get out top 2 teams as the finalists.

**Playing 11 Prediction**

In order to generate the playing eleven players for the finalist teams, we used the datasets given below:

1. playerwise_df.csv:

2. deliveries.csv

To generate the final playing eleven players for finalist teams, we used the following .ipynb files which were imported as pickle files and used in our api's 'predict_playing11' function:

1. total_runs_wickets_prediction.ipynb

This file predicts the 'total_runs' and 'total_wickets' based on 'venue', 'team', 'opposing_team' and 'player'. Basically, this file predicts the runs the player will make and the wickets the player will take in his match against the opposing team.
We import this file as runs_wickets_prediction.pkl and used it in api.py to predict the runs which will be made by each of the player of a team and also the wickets that player will take in the match. 

Based on this dataset, we now predict the final playing eleven by sorting the predicted runs and wickets in the descending order. The top eleven players with most runs and wickets will be taken as the final playing eleven for the final match.

# Task 3

**Winner Prediction**

In order to generate the winner team, we used the dataset given below:

1. matches.csv

To generate the winner team, we used the following .ipynb file which was imported as pickle files and used in our api's 'predict_winner' function:

1. toss_decision.ipynb

2. total_run_prediction_inning_1.ipynb

3. total_run_prediction_inning_2.ipynb

4. total_over_pediction.ipynb

We again use the same method to predict the winner. First we call the 'predict_finalist' function to findout the finalist teams in ICC World Cup. Now, we take these two finalist teams as input. We predict the toss decision, followed by the runs made by team 1 in inning 1 and overs played by team 1 in inning 1. Next, we find the runs made by team 2 in inning 2 and overs played by team 2 in inning 2. Based on the runs and overs, we then declare the winner.
